enough for 85%

This first week was good. It was awesome to get to know the instructor and learn that we're going to be learning things that will carry value in our engineering journey. I really enjoy the memes and the style of teaching, I'm a pretty visual person and I love a fun class.

We've been introduced to some pretty cool things. I mean the first thing that we viewed in this class was a really cool video about King Kong and how they made those visuals and graphics. I thought that was the coolest thing ever and it gave me a good perspective on how the graphics all came together to make this awesome fight scene. (side note: how did they make these cool models like King Kong so realistic)

This first assignment I didn't struggle with until I was trying to figure out how to make a method inside a function. This was not as clear to me because I haven't seen it in any other language. It all made sense once I was able to piece it all together, but when I was reading through the instructions I had no idea how this would've looked. It's pretty cool and fast how you can make these objects, it almost seems like it shouldn't be possible to make objects like that and make methods inside other functions... weird.

I was very surprised to see how easy things came to me when developing this cool intro assignment. I really went out of my way to get comfortable with Git again. I went on a lil adventure and started getting my aliases set up that I had set up on a different device during the summer (internship)

And it was also mentioned that the company was migrating to GitHub, so I started making branches and just creating pull requests for me to accept just to see how that flow went. 

The assignment was complete and I didn't aim for 100%, maybe next week. I felt a lil unmotivated this week and busy with all my RA stuff.
