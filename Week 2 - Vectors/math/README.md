The concepts that I learned this week was how surprisingly simple vectors were, except for a few concepts. What really stuck out to me was how easy it was to add vectors and how vectors were drawn on graphs. It's pretty easy to go and draw out a vector given, like go right 3 and up 2. And if it was in a different directon, we would just follow the same pattern to draw this vector.

Alongside these simple concepts, came harder to understand concepts like the different formulas. Not like normalization, but like the dot product and other functions that we did on our homework: `fromTo` and `project`. This was a bit harder for me to understand, especially the `fromTo` which I wasn't even able to complete. `project` was a bit easier to understand, but I did have to read some of the wikipedia page to get a better understading.

The `add`, `subtract`, `negate`, and other simple methods were pretty easy to implement as it was pretty straightforward in just modifying the member variables of the vector and applying the value to it. This was really enjoyable and was satisfying to see these tests passing, especially for the `add` and `subtract` method (i was doing it wrong for the longest time, but it was a really simple solution).

A thing I really enjoyed while programming this assignment was learning more of what JavaScript can do, especially with these built-in libraries: `Math.` and `JSON.` These allowed me to save a lot of time writing out like `(vector.x * vector.x)` as `Math.pow(vector.x, 2)` and made it much simpler! I also miss writing a more modern language, since over the summer I was writing a lot of Java and started to write Kotlin a bit more near the end, so writing JavaScript is so fun to me. My partner likes to do the semicolons at the end, but I like to not have those since I think it looks more cool.
