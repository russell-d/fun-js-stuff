This week I learned about Shadow Mapping which was pretty cool because this is a thing I knew that video games had. I didn't know there was a difference of having ray tracing shadows and shadow mapping shadows so that was cool to learn. Not sure if I'd rather have ray tracing over shadow mapping, since ray tracing looks to take more performance and shadow mapping looks good enough. 

On the programming assignment, it was somewhat simple and it was pretty cool to see the progression of how different textures looked with the shadows. The biggest challenge was just trying to manage which textures I'm testing the code out with and I was sometimes using the wrong textures and it was messing me up. I also had a super big issue with getting the shadow to follow the light, which I fixed using the variables provided when setting up the camera. 

This assignment wasn't bad at all and I thought it was pretty fun especially being able to play with the direction of the light and making the shadow change. Super fun and interactive, which kept me motivated to finish it.
