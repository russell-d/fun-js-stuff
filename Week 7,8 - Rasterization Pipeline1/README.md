The concepts that I learned this week were the differences between rasterization and raytracing. Basically raytracing is generating rays for each pixel in an image. While rasterization is like creating pixels for each object in a scene. 

Image-centric vs object-centric.

I found rasterization easier to understand, but raytracing made sense to me in the looking at it way. Not sure if that makes sense, I can understand both but I can probably visualize raytracing better.

For the programming assignment, I actually did not struggle a lot. It was pretty simple and actually kinda fun building this thing and seeing my progress. I liked going from a big triangle, to a small triangle, to a colored triangle, to a spining colored triangle.

I had some issues when it came to coloring the triangle, mostly because I wasn't setting the RGB matrix correctly. Because I was thinking RGB, I made:

255, 0, 0
0, 255, 0
0,   0, 255

This messed me up and I was getting a weird looking colored triangle. I finally figure it out and got the colored triangle.

I then struggled with creating the rotation for a bit, but after coming back to it and realziing what made a matrix rotate.. I finally got it

This assignment was very fun and satisfying!!
