This week I learned about how hard WebGL is... Just kidding. It was a lot of more detailed things that we can do within WebGL like adding textures and make things transparent. These are things that could be super powerful when creating actual useful things that people will be using with WebGL. Things like video games or even models of stuff, having transparency is super useful. And so are textures, since things would probably need more detail than being a smooth color or so.

These concepts in the programming assignment were super relevant and it was actually really fun to see the things come together. The most exciting one was making that one grid: ![IMG_8467](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53790643/199404781-c05fe0f3-93ea-4ec5-9693-4cea1cd968ea.png)

This was the coolest thing ever and being able to move it with my mouse was super fun too. And then making the spheres was pretty cool too and adding the textures, it just felt like everything was coming together pretty well and smooth. ![IMG_9988](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53790643/199404896-a8b82a81-9a66-4fae-b191-3088278976a9.png)

I was super excited about ^ making it transparent because it felt so awesome.

Overall, was a really fun assignment and I enjoy WebGL so far, but I just hate having to go across so many files and stuff.
