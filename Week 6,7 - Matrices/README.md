This week was great! Learning matrices was a familiar concept that I've done before and most especially during technical interviewing. Matrix methods were simple and concepts were easy like identity matrices and multiplying matrices. Adding and subtracting matrices were also simple, but unneeded for what we were learning. Rotating was also simple as well and it was just a lot of information honestly.

Applying these concepts to programming was straightforward, it was pretty simple. If you understood the concepts, you can definitely code it since it's just changing values in an array that represents a matrix. What took me a bit was just creating lil pictures in the code using comments that helped me create these methods and understand it pretty well.

Things went very well and I was confident when my partner and I were working on it. We collaborated really well since we met up at the library and we were able to get a lot done together and understand these concepts and put them into code. I think meeting up and working together in-person is definitely something that we'll be doing since it helps us collaborate better!

Overall, good assignment and kinda fun
