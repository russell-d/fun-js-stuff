Learning Ray Intersections was pretty hard. Actually, it was pretty easy during the lecture. Rays are pretty simple, as it's basically a point that goes in a certain direction. That certain direction is fixed, but the length of that direction is determined by the alpha. Actually pretty simple to me.

And with the sphere intersection, it was also somewhat simple as it's just if a point from a ray hits the sphere then it's intersected it. It was pretty formula heavy, but once I was able to process and break down these formulas then it was pretty simple. It was also weird to see the quadratic formula again, because I thought we left that thing in 2nd year of college. 

Something that was really helpful was that whiteboarding session during the lecture, I didn't really get it and got confused during the lecture but watching it again.. I understood it pretty well, just not once I started coding it.

Coding it was really bad in the beginning, but once I started getting into the groove of things I started to piece more things together. Ultimately, I wasn't able to fully finish it, but I did feel good about the direction I was heading in. The most difficult part was just figuring out what the `ray.js` was and what it did and what all the other pieces did. I feel like I was missing a big part of the puzzle during this. I wish I had attended office hours, and that's something that I need to take advantage of, as it's a great resource.
