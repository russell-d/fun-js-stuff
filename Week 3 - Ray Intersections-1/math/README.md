Learning Ray Intersections was pretty hard. Actually, it was pretty easy during the lecture. Rays are pretty simple, as it's basically a point that goes in a certain direction. That certain direction is fixed, but the length of that direction is determined by the alpha. Actually pretty simple to me.

And with the sphere intersection, it was also somewhat simple as it's just if a point from a ray hits the sphere then it's intersected it.
